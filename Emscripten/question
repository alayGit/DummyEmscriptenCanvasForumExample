I am having trouble getting a Canvas, which is transfered to a PThread to display images.

Interestingly when I pause the debugger, the canvas updates, but when I resume again the canvas remains static.

This to me rules out any issue with the data or the provision of that data to the canvas. 

My application is really complicated, so I created replicated the issue in a 'dummy program' which just displays static data.

I am hoping that someone can tell me what I am doing wrong.

If there is a better way of providing the code then here please let me know. This is the best I could find.
